libmatewnck
===========

libmatewnck is Window Navigator Construction Kit, i.e. a library to use
for writing pagers and taskslists and stuff.  

libmatewnck is not supported in the devel platform, which means OS vendors
won't guarantee the API/ABI long-term, but authors of open source apps
should feel free to use libmatewnck as users can always recompile against
a new version. The API/ABI has historically changed very little: we are
not changing it gratuitously or without soname increments.

Documentation for the API is available with gtk-doc. The code
implementing the tasklist or pager widgets (tasklist.c and pager.c) can
also be used as sample code.

You may download updates to the package from:

Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'. If you are not using a released version of
libmatewnck (for example, if you checked out the code from git), you first
need to run './autogen.sh'.
